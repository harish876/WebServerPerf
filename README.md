### Simple C vs Rust Web Server Bench

## Goal for now
1. P0 is libuv implementation and parallel port of libuv in rust. Benchmark threads vs async IO
2. Benchmark simple echo endpoint
3. Canonical Library for JSON parsing
4. Canonical Library for HTTP parsing (if needed)
5. Make a list of endpoints like simple echo, json parsing, maybe POST request etc... for benchmarking
